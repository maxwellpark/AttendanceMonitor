# AttendanceMonitor

Track attendance for events with this user-friendly web application. Uses predominantly server-side rendering (and minimal JavaScript) with PHP EngineX, which provides higher performance and security.
There are very few dependencies, which makes the app lightweight. 

## How to run the app 

- Fire up XAMPP (or equivalent) and start the Apache and MySQL services. 
- Navigate to 'http://localhost:[portno.]/' in your browser of choice. 
- Credentials for test user accounts (to be used in development) can be found in the /private/plaintext.txt file.

## Naming conventions 

- Capitalised php filenames denote classes 
- Snake_case php filenames denote scripts
